In the era of pervasive cyber threats and exponential growth in digital services, the inad- equacy of single-factor authentication has become increasingly evident. Multi-Factor Au- thentication (MFA), which combines knowledge-based factors (passwords, PINs), possession- based factors (smart cards, tokens), and inherence-based factors (biometric traits), has emerged as a robust defense mechanism. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning have trans- formed the capabilities of biometric systems, enabling higher accuracy, resilience to spoofing, and seamless integration with hardware-based solutions. At the same time, smart card tech- nologies have evolved to include on-chip biometric verification, cryptographic processing, and secure storage, thereby enabling compact and secure multi-factor devices. This survey presents a comprehensive synthesis of recent work (2019–2025) at the in- tersection of deep learning, biometrics, and smart card technologies for MFA. We analyze biometric modalities (face, fingerprint, iris, voice), review hardware-based approaches (smart cards, NFC, TPMs, secure enclaves), and highlight integration strategies for real-world ap- plications such as digital banking, healthcare Io T, and critical infrastructure. Furthermore, we discuss the major challenges that remain open, including usability–security tradeoffs, ad- versarial attacks on deep learning models, privacy concerns surrounding biometric data, and the need for standardization in MFA deployment. By consolidating current advancements, limitations, and research opportunities, this survey provides a roadmap for designing secure, scalable, and user-friendly authentication frameworks. Keywords: Multi-Factor Authentication, Deep Learning, Biometrics, Smart Cards, Digital Banking Security. In today’s hyperconnected digital environment, safeguarding user identity has become more critical than ever. With increasing reports of data breaches, phishing scams, and account hi- jacking, traditional password-based authentication has proven insufficient. Passwords are not only prone to being forgotten or reused, but are also vulnerable to brute-force attacks, phishing, and database leaks. These vulnerabilities have driven the widespread adoption of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) as a more robust alternative. MFA relies on the combination of independent identity factors—something the user knows (e.g., a password), something they have (e.g., a smart card), and something they are (e.g., a biometric trait). This layered approach significantly improves security by ensuring that com- promising one factor does not grant access to protected systems. According to recent sur- veys , modern digital services, including financial platforms compliant with regulations such as PSD2, increasingly require MFA to mitigate risks associated with single-factor systems. Privacy-preserving MFA approaches leveraging deep learning and biometrics have also been proposed . 1 Biometric authentication, including modalities such as face, fingerprint, iris, and voice recog- nition, has emerged as a popular inherence factor in MFA systems . Biometrics offer non- transferable, user-specific traits, improving usability and reducing reliance on memory. Yet, they raise unique challenges in terms of spoofing, privacy, and demographic bias . Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have significantly improved the accuracy and reliabil- ity of biometric systems. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other deep architectures have shown strong performance in extracting robust features from noisy or occluded biomet- ric data, enabling real-time and multimodal biometric authentication . DL techniques also power liveness detection, domain adaptation, and template security, enhancing resilience against spoofing and adversarial attacks . In parallel, possession-based factors have evolved. Smart cards, Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), and secure enclaves now provide cryptographic computation, biometric match-on-card, and tamper-resistant credential storage. Recent advances in biometric payment cards and NFC- enabled devices illustrate how hardware tokens can securely integrate with DL-based biometric authentication to form compact and user-friendly MFA schemes . These solutions reduce fraud while ensuring compliance with data protection requirements. Despite this progress, several open challenges remain: ensuring usability without degrad- ing security, defending against presentation attacks, preserving biometric privacy, and ensuring interoperability across vendors and regulatory frameworks . Objectives. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent research (2019–2025) on DL-based MFA systems integrating biometrics and smart cards. Specifically, it: • Reviews deep learning methods applied to biometric authentication within MFA frame- works. • Examines smart card and hardware-based approaches for secure factor integration. • Compares architectures, fusion strategies, datasets, and benchmarks employed in state-of- the-art systems. • Analyzes threat models and countermeasures against adversarial and spoofing attacks. • Identifies open research questions and outlines future directions for scalable, privacy- preserving, and user-friendly authentication. 2 Background: MFA, Biometrics, and Smart Cards Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security mechanism that requires users to verify their identity using a combination of independent factors, typically categorized as knowledge (some- thing the user knows), possession (something the user has), and inherence (something the user is) . The rationale behind MFA is that compromising multiple independent factors is signifi- cantly harder for attackers, thus enhancing overall system security. Traditionally, authentication relied heavily on passwords. However, due to their susceptibility to guessing, phishing, and large-scale leaks, passwords alone have become increasingly risky. In response, MFA has been adopted across domains handling sensitive data, particularly digital banking, e-government, and healthcare Io T . Biometric authentication represents the “inherence” factor, leveraging physiological traits (e.g., face, fingerprint, iris) or behavioral patterns (e.g., gait, keystroke dynamics). Unlike pass- words or tokens, biometric traits are intrinsic to individuals and difficult to replicate. However, they raise challenges such as privacy concerns, irrevocability, and vulnerability to spoofing at- tacks . To mitigate these risks, standardization bodies (e.g., ISO/IEC 30107) have proposed presentation attack detection (PAD) guidelines, and researchers are increasingly focused on fair- ness and robustness across demographics . 2 Smart cards, typically associated with the “possession” factor, are tamper-resistant hardware devices capable of securely storing credentials, cryptographic keys, and even performing biomet- ric matching. In the banking sector, EMV-compliant cards enable secure offline authentication through digital signatures. When combined with biometrics, smart cards can implement match- on-card verification, ensuring that sensitive templates never leave the card’s secure chip . Beyond traditional smart cards, Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) and Secure Enclaves extend these guarantees to general-purpose devices such as smartphones and laptops. These components isolate sensitive data and computations, enabling secure biometric enrollment, in- ference, and key storage, and underpin modern standards such as FIDO2 and Web Authn. In practice, effective MFA requires balancing usability, cost, and risk. A typical modern system may combine: a fingerprint scan (inherence), a smartphone secure enclave or biometric smart card (possession), and a PIN or behavioral pattern (knowledge/behavior). The integra- tion of deep learning into biometric systems—coupled with trusted hardware—marks the next evolution in MFA, explored in detail in the following sections. Deep learning (DL) has fundamentally transformed biometric authentication by enabling end- to-end learning, robust feature extraction, and scalability across diverse modalities. Traditional biometric systems relied on handcrafted features, which often lacked generalizability across pop- ulations or environmental conditions. DL models — particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers — now power state-of-the-art systems for face, fingerprint, iris, voice, and behavioral biometrics . 3.1 Facial Recognition and Anti-Spoofing Facial recognition has rapidly advanced with architectures such as Face Net , Arc Face , and Cos Face , which learn highly discriminative embeddings from images. Wang and Deng survey modern DL-based face recognition. However, face systems remain vulnerable to spoofing (2D photos, replay videos, 3D masks). Liveness detection networks address this by analyzing texture, motion cues, or physiological signals (e.g., eye blinking, r PPG). Guo et al. proposed CNN-based liveness detection, while recent works integrate anti-deepfake detection. 3.2 Fingerprint and Iris Recognition DL enhances fingerprint authentication by improving minutiae detection, ridge classification, and partial print matching. Zahid et al. show CNNs outperform traditional Gabor-based methods under noisy conditions. Similarly, iris recognition benefits from CNNs and attention- based models trained on datasets such as CASIA-Iris and ND-Iris, robust to illumination and pupil dilation . 3.3 Voice and Behavioral Biometrics DL also advances speaker verification via spectrogram-based CNNs and LSTM embeddings. Combining voice with face (audiovisual biometrics) strengthens robustness for remote banking authentication . Behavioral biometrics — keystroke, gait, touchscreen, mouse movement — enable continuous MFA. Verma et al. demonstrate smartphone motion-based DL models for adaptive MFA. 3 algorithms. The synergy between biometric recognition and possession-based hardware is foun- dational to secure MFA. 4.1 Smart Cards in MFA Systems Smart cards have long been used in authentication due to their ability to securely store user credentials and perform local computations. In modern MFA, biometric smart cards (BSCs) integrate fingerprint or facial recognition sensors directly into the card or terminal. There are two main architectures: • Match-on-Card (Mo C): Biometric matching is performed entirely on the card’s chip, and the template never leaves the card. This ensures maximum privacy. • Match-off-Card: The biometric is matched externally, with the template read from the card. This mode is more flexible but less private. Mo C provides superior privacy and is increasingly supported by commercial products such as Idemia’s biometric payment cards and Gemalto’s biometric EMV solutions, with technical standards maintained by EMVCo . 4.4 Smart Card + DL System Architectures Recent architectures combine deep learning with secure hardware to enhance biometric verifica- tion: • DL on-chip: Miniaturized CNNs embedded in smart cards or tokens. • Secure template fusion: Combining multiple traits (e.g., fingerprint + iris) with fused templates stored in secure elements. • On-device adaptation: DL models fine-tuned per user during enrollment, stored within TEEs. Tani et al. (2025) validated the feasibility of such architectures for real-world banking au- thentication . 4.5 Challenges in Hardware-Based MFA Despite their advantages, hardware-integrated MFA systems face challenges: • Cost and Scalability: Biometric smart cards are more expensive than traditional tokens. • Hardware Standardization: Fragmentation across vendors complicates integration. • Energy Constraints: DL inference on low-power chips requires lightweight models and quantization. Ongoing research explores energy-efficient DL models and secure co-processors to address these limitations . The integration of deep learning (DL)–based biometric authentication with traditional MFA systems introduces several design options depending on modality fusion, user experience (UX) requirements, and environmental constraints. This section discusses core system-level integration strategies, such as fusion techniques, adaptive MFA policies, and UX considerations like latency. 5.1 Fusion Techniques in DL-Based MFA To leverage the strengths of multiple authentication factors—especially in multimodal biometrics— systems often use fusion strategies to combine different sources of evidence. Fusion can occur at various levels : • Sensor-Level Fusion: Raw biometric signals (e.g., fingerprint + face) are captured and preprocessed jointly. • Feature-Level Fusion: Deep embeddings from CNN/RNN models are concatenated before classification. • Score-Level Fusion: Independent DL models output match scores that are weighted and combined. • Decision-Level Fusion: Each modality votes independently; a decision is made based on predefined logic (e.g., majority voting). Score-level fusion offers a balance between flexibility and performance, and is widely used in commercial systems. Decision-level fusion is preferred in scenarios with hardware heterogeneity or legacy compatibility. 7 6.5 Summary DL-based MFA improves identity assurance but still faces challenges in adversarial robustness, deepfake resistance, privacy, and bias mitigation. The future of trustworthy MFA depends on standardized testing, open datasets, and secure hardware-software co-design. 6.6 Standardization and Interoperability DL-MFA systems often combine heterogeneous sensors, inference engines, and secure hardware. Without standards, integration is fragile and error-prone. Key standards include: FIDO2/Web Authn, ISO/IEC 30107 (PAD), and EMVCo for biometric payment cards . Future work must em- phasize pluggable frameworks, formal verification of workflows, and government-led certification (e.g., e IDAS, NIST 800-63). 6.7 Summary While DL-based MFA significantly strengthens digital identity protection, its adoption intro- duces challenges in robustness, privacy, fairness, and interoperability. Addressing these threats requires cross-disciplinary efforts spanning ML research, hardware security, regulatory compli- ance, and usability studies. 7 Datasets, Benchmarks, and Metrics Robust evaluation of DL-based MFA systems requires standardized biometric datasets and con- sistent performance metrics. This section presents widely used benchmarks for facial, fingerprint, iris, and multimodal biometrics, and outlines key evaluation criteria such as FAR, FRR, and EER. 7.1 Benchmark Datasets for Biometric MFA Research in DL-powered biometric authentication relies on curated datasets that represent dif- ferent modalities under diverse conditions. The quality and bias of these datasets significantly influence model generalizability. Well-established datasets underpin biometric research. Examples include LFW , VG- GFace2 , Age DB , CASIA-Iris V4 , and FVC2004 , which have become de facto benchmarks for DL-based evaluation. Many of these datasets include variations in lighting, pose, aging, and acquisition devices to simulate real-world conditions. Public availability supports benchmarking and fair comparison across DL architectures. 7.2 Performance Metrics in MFA Systems Accurate evaluation of DL-based MFA systems requires standardized biometric metrics and protocols, as defined in ISO/IEC 19795 and NIST SP 800-63B . These standards ensure comparability across algorithms, datasets, and deployment environments. • False Acceptance Rate (FAR): Probability that an impostor is incorrectly accepted as a genuine user. FAR is critical for measuring system security and is often reported at operating points such as FAR = 10−3 or 10−4. • False Rejection Rate (FRR): Probability that a legitimate user is incorrectly rejected. FRR reflects system usability and user experience. 11 G. Guo, N. Zhang, and M.
