Sarcasm is a nuanced and often misinterpreted form of communication, especially in text, where tone and body language are absent. This paper presents a proposed modular deep learning framework for sarcasm detection, leveraging Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and contextual models like BERT to analyze linguistic, emotional, and contextual cues . The system is conceptually designed to integrate sentiment analysis, contextual embeddings, linguistic feature extraction, and emotion detection through a multi-layer architecture. Although the model is not yet implemented, the design demonstrates feasi- bility for real-world applications like chatbots and social media monitoring . Additional discussions on data preprocessing techniques, model evaluation strategies, and ethical implications further contextualize the approach .

INTRODUCTION Sarcasm detection is vital for enhancing the interpretabil- ity of automated systems like sentiment analyzers, chatbots, and recommendation engines . While humans rely on context, tone, and expressions, machines must infer sarcasm from textual patterns alone. This paper explores a concep- tual solution using DCNNs combined with contextual embedding models to understand sarcasm’s complex indicators such as irony, sentiment contradiction, and hyper- bole. Applications range from content moderation on social platforms to enhancing virtual assistant interactions . II. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION Sarcasm is a complex form of communication that relies heavily on tone, context, and cultural cues . Humans often detect sarcasm by recognizing exaggerated language, contra- dictions, or situational irony, which are difficult for machines to grasp. Traditional text processing tools typically fail to interpret such nuanced expressions . With the emergence of deep learning models like CNNs and transformers , it has become feasible to explore sarcasm detection using machine learning. This paper proposes a deep neural architecture that mimics this human-like understanding by analyzing multiple model achieved superior performance on social media sarcasm datasets. Sharma et al. developed a hybrid autoencoder model capable of capturing both shallow and deep semantic patterns, contributing to accurate sarcasm classification in social media posts. Eke et al. focused on context-based feature engineering using BERT, proposing a system that leverages sentence-level embeddings and fine-tuned transformers to boost classification accuracy. These prior works demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning methods in sarcasm detection. However, many lack scalability, explainability, or modularity. Our work builds upon these foundations, proposing a modular framework that uni- fies sentiment, context, linguistic cues, and emotion analysis into an adaptable and extensible system for robust sarcasm detection.

Neural Networks A Neural Network is a machine learning model inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected neurons arranged in layers. Each layer processes input data through weighted connections and activation functions to learn patterns and make decisions . Fig. 3. Structure of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network V. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY The proposed sarcasm detection system is designed using a modular architecture composed of four specialized detec- tion modules that collaboratively interpret different linguistic signals. These include: • Sentiment Analysis: This module employs VADER or BERT-based sentiment analysis models to capture the emotional polarity of a sentence . Sarcasm often involves polarity flips—where positive sentiment is ex- pressed with a negative undertone or vice versa. VADER, with its rule-based sentiment scoring, excels in social media text, while BERT captures deeper contextual sen- timent shifts. • Contextual Embedding: Powered by BERT, this module encodes the input sentence into high-dimensional vectors that reflect contextual meaning . Unlike traditional embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec), BERT dynamically adjusts word meanings based on their sentence context, which is crucial in understanding nuanced sarcasm. • Linguistic Features: This component utilizes Spa Cy and custom NLP rules to extract syntactic and semantic cues such as punctuation usage, exaggerated expressions, all caps, and interjections (e.g., ”Yeah, right!”) . Fig. 1. Illustration of a Basic Neural Network • Emotion Detection: A CNN/LSTM hybrid model is used to detect underlying emotional tone such as frustration, amusement, or confusion . These emotions, when mismatched with surface sentiment, often signal sarcastic intent. B. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) CNNs are specialized neural networks designed to process data with grid-like topology, such as images or text matrices. They use convolutional layers to detect patterns like edges or textual features, followed by pooling layers to reduce dimensionality . The outputs from these modules are concatenated into a unified feature vector, followed by normalization and trans- formation layers. The fused vector is passed to a meta- classifier—typically a logistic regression model or a shallow neural network—which outputs a binary classification: sarcas- tic or non-sarcastic . The system supports flexibility and C.

VII. DATA PREPROCESSING Ensuring fairness begins with curating diverse and repre- sentative datasets. Sarcasm is heavily culture-dependent and varies across languages, dialects, and social groups. A model trained primarily on English tweets from a specific region may generalize poorly to other linguistic contexts. Incorpo- rating datasets from varied cultural and demographic sources improves fairness and inclusivity . Transparency and explainability are equally critical. End- users and developers should be able to understand why a specific piece of content was labeled as sarcastic. Techniques like LIME and SHAP help visualize feature importance and decision rationale . Moreover, models should include feedback loops that allow users to flag misclassifications, facilitating continual learning and correction . Privacy preservation is essential when scraping social media data for training. Proper anonymization and ethical approval must be obtained before model development. Finally, regular auditing of models for bias, drift, and ethical compliance en- sures that systems remain accountable and socially responsible throughout their lifecycle . VI. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE Fig. 4. Proposed Modular System Architecture for Sarcasm Detection VIII. CASE STUDY The system architecture is structured into a layered pipeline starting with input ingestion and preprocessing, followed by parallel feature extraction streams and a final aggregation layer. 1. Input Preprocessing: Text data is collected from social media platforms and undergoes extensive cleaning—removal of special characters, hashtags, emojis, links, and user handles. The cleaned text is tokenized and passed through lemmatiza- tion for standardization . 2. Feature Extraction Modules: The input is fed simul- taneously into sentiment, contextual, linguistic, and emotion detection modules. Each module processes the text indepen- dently, producing an output feature vector that encapsulates its specialized analysis . 3. Aggregation and Fusion: Feature vectors from all mod- ules are aggregated using concatenation and passed through dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA or attention-based fusion) to form a composite representation. This vector is processed by the classification engine . 4. Classification Layer: A meta-classifier, trained on la- beled sarcasm datasets, takes the fused representation and outputs the probability of the text being sarcastic. Logistic re- gression or shallow feedforward neural networks are typically used at this stage . 5. Feedback Loop: User feedback is captured through upvotes/downvotes or flags, enabling continuous retraining and improving the model’s precision over time. This adaptive learning loop enhances robustness to evolving sarcastic trends . Such a modular design supports horizontal scalabil- ity—modules can be parallelized or independently opti- mized—while ensuring maintainability and extensibility of the system. A conceptual case study evaluates our framework on a multimodal sarcasm dataset comprising text-image tweet pairs. Text is encoded via BERT, while images are processed using Dense Net for visual sarcasm features such as facial expres- sions, contextual image cues, or meme-style exaggeration . This method ensures that both language and visual content contribute to the sarcasm prediction process. The dataset used in the study includes publicly available labeled tweets containing sarcastic hashtags such as #sarcasm, #irony, and #not. Each tweet was paired with its respective image and then preprocessed—text was tokenized and em- bedded using BERT, while images were resized and fed into a pre-trained Dense Net. Feature vectors from both models were concatenated and passed to a fusion classifier for final sarcasm prediction . Fig. 5. Model Accuracy Comparison on Twitter Dataset The results demonstrate clear advantages of multimodal learning. BERT alone achieved an accuracy of 88.6%, Dense Net alone achieved 74.3%, and the combined model reached 93.2%. These findings confirm that visual signals add significant value in identifying sarcasm, especially when textual cues are ambiguous . In a practical application scenario, this model could assist content moderators by automatically flagging sarcastic content, thus enhancing sentiment analysis systems. Future studies could expand this work by exploring multilingual sarcastic tweets, using emotion-labeled image datasets, and integrating audio cues such as tone and inflection . User-centered evaluation through crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) can further validate the model’s predictions by comparing them with human judg- ments. This process enhances the credibility of sarcasm clas- sification in real-world deployments . X. REFERENCES
